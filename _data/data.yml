    summary: |
      Driven, self-taught aspiring Platform Engineer and relationship builder determined to unblock problems for companies that want to modernise and become more efficient through the use of technology.
      Early foundation in IT Support, bulk as a technical recruiter and most recently a Platform Engineer, I bring a self starter attitude and experience serving stakeholders in challenging environments both large and small.
      Over the last two years specifically, I have been working towards a career change back to hands on IT, gaining proficiency and professional certifications in Google Cloud and associated technologies for a leading Google Cloud Partner while building their technical teams.
